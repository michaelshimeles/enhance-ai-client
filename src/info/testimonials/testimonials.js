    testimonial: `I'm a social media manager and EnhanceAI truly made me work so much
    faster! There have been too many times where I've spent WAY too much
    time on a post caption, trying to think of a unique, witty or
    un-repetitive starting sentence (which can get a little frustrating/and
    time consuming). Having something to help with caption writing really
    helps me be more efficient and helps me complete my work A LOT quicker!
    There is even an option where you can pick the tone of a caption, which
    is really helpful when a brand has a specific brand tone you need to
    follow! This has truly been a life-saver!`,
